  <h1>REGEX Tutorial</h1>

    <textarea cols=50 id='input'>Prior to Joc Pederson's first game at Dodger Stadium as a visiting player, the Chicago Cubs outfielder received his 2020-21
    World Series ring and got a special surprise from his former team.
    
    Per Alyssa Hertel of USA Today, Pederson's older brother, Champ, was also given a World Series ring by the Dodgers. In that same article, Joc noted that Dodgers executive vice president Lon Rosen brought Champ into the team's locker
    room during their celebration after clinching the National League West title in 2015-16.
    
    "Just before I could take in how surreal the moment actually was, I saw my brother Champ across the room. Goggles on.
    Pouring champagne on his head right along with the guys," he wrote. "Of course, he's not a player, but it was just
    natural to see Champ there."
    
    Champ threw out the first pitch to Joc at Dodger Stadium in 2017-18 on Joc's bobblehead night before a game against the St.
    Louis Cardinals.</textarea>
